While <a href="https://github.com/koayact/D3js/blob/main/SASB-Standards-2024%20by%20Andrew%20Koay.html">SASB</a> provides a structure for ESG (Environmental, Social, <u>G</u>overnance) disclosures, I underscore the <u>G</u>overnance as it also applies to all listed companies on Stock Exchanges since they are <i>Promoting Transparent And Efficient Capital Markets FN-EX-410a.4</i> to align sustainability efforts with investor expectations.  Screenshot below also captures <i>Managing Business Continuity And Technology Risks: FN-EX-550a.1 on Market Disruptions; FN-EX-550a.2 on Data Breaches; and FN-EX-550a.3 on Efforts to Prevent Technology Errors, Security Breaches and Market Disruptions.</i>

<a href="https://github.com/koayact/D3js/blob/main/SASB-Standards-2024%20by%20Andrew%20Koay.html">SASB</a> however, does not prescribe governance and control practices.  ES<u>G</u> disclosure topics and metrics including Data Privacy and Cybersecurity can be addressed operationally within <a href="https://github.com/koayact/D3js/blob/main/ISACA-COBIT2019%20by%20Andrew%20Koay.html">ISACA COBIT 2019 Framework</a> or <a href="https://github.com/koayact/D3js/blob/main/NIST-CSF2.0%20by%20Andrew%20Koay.html">NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0</a>.  For example, organisational responses to data breaches - including root cause analysis, corrective actions, and risk treatment - are governed in COBIT through domains like <i>Evaluate, Direct, Monitor (EDM)</i> for risk oversight, <i>Align, Plan, Organise (APO)</i> for governance, architecture safeguards and third-party risk, <i>Deliver, Service & Support (DSS)</i> for incident management, and <i>Monitor, Evaluate, Assess (MEA)</i> for compliance, audit and assurance. These controls enable accurate and credible reporting of sustainability metrics for investors under SASB.

Among the universe of 11 sectors across 77 industries in <a href="https://github.com/koayact/D3js/blob/main/SASB-Standards-2024%20by%20Andrew%20Koay.html">SASB</a>, below are a few more screenshots on governance disclosure topics and metrics.  Hope the community finds these visualisations useful in fightingback greenwashing and showing impact on sustainability for environmental and social benefits.
